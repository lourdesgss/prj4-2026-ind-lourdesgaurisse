## Context

Canon Production Printing is a company headquartered in Venlo, The Netherlands, specialising in creating software solutions that allow customers to manage their document processes and printer fleet. Canon continuously works to improve print quality, reliability, and production efficiency. One important aspect of this process is the calibration and optimisation of printheads, which are responsible for generating and ejecting microscopic drops of ink onto a substrate.

To achieve high-quality prints, the electrical signals (known as waveforms) used to drive each nozzle in the printhead must be tuned. These waveforms influence factors such as droplet size, velocity, and trajectory. Waveform parameters often need to be adjusted to ensure consistent performance across the entire printhead.

## Problem

Waveform tuning is a complex task due to the large number of parameters and the variability between nozzles. Changes in waveform shape, amplitude, or timing can affect droplet formation, which influences the final printed result. If these parameters are not well calibrated, issues such as visible print defects may occur.

Tuning these parameters relies heavily on manual experimentation. However, this approach becomes inefficient when dealing with many parameter spaces and nozzles, making it difficult to determine optimal configurations.

In this project, a dataset containing color measurements generated from many different waveform configurations is available. Each configuration modifies waveform parameters and records the resulting color output. The challenge is to analyze this dataset and uncover relationships between waveform parameters and printed color results.

Without a predictive model, identifying waveform configurations that produce consistent results across all nozzles requires manual trial-and-error testing.

## Proposed Solution

This project proposes a data-driven approach to waveform tuning using predictive modeling. By learning the relationship between waveform configurations and color results, the model can help identify parameter combinations that improve uniformity across printheads.

Throughout the project, the CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology will be applied to structure the workflow, guiding the process from business understanding and data exploration to modelling, evaluation, and deployment. This framework provides a structured and repeatable approach for developing data-driven solutions within engineering environments.
